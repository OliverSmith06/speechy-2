# speechy-2
This python script(s) was an attempt to automate tasks on my computer through voice commands. 
I used multithreading to process enable the script to listen for new commands, process commands, and run the output all at once.

To give it a spin, load up multithreading.py and try saying "PLAY VIDEO" to play a cute video (you need to run on windows and have chrome in default directory)
